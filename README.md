# This is a portfolio of all the Data Science projects I have completed

## [Project 1: Glassdoor-Salary-Analysis](https://github.com/MarlinMyrte/Glassdoor-Salary-Analysis)

- Created a tool that estimates mainly Salaries using Glassdoor.com data based on keyword search using python and selenium. The tools is mainly designed for Data Science related jobs.
- For scraping the website, the code from [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905) article was used as a base. However, the code was outdated and presented a lot of bugs so I fixed extensively
- The scraper collects by default 180 job listings from Glassdoor. After that limit, Glassdoor keeps repeating the same jobs listings.
- Extracted keywords from the job description in order to quantify the value that each skill adds to the salary.
- Optimized Linear, Lasso and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model

## [Project 2: Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/MarlinMyrte/Titanic-Dataset)

My submission for the Kaggle Titanic competition

Accuracy 78.47% - Top 17%

- Performed preprocessing on the dataset by parsing columns or creating new features
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis
- Tested various Machine Learning models
- Further tuned the models and created ensembles
- Submitted the results


## [Project 3: NBA: First minutes of a game (Part 1)](https://github.com/MarlinMyrte/First-Minutes-Part-1)

In this project I wanted to test something that I had observed while watching NBA Games. I noticed that during the first 2-3 minutes of each quarter, players seem more "relaxed" compared to the rest of the quarter and I wanted to check if my hypothesis is True or not

This project involved:
- Extracting Play-by-Play data from the NBA API
- Cleaning the data and performing some feature engineering
- Plotting results to check for patterns
- Testing multiple statistical hypotheses

### Results

We can see that there is indeed a drop in the combined point production during the first minutes of each quarter, however it bounces back fairly quickly.

The statistical test confirms our initial hypothesis that there is a difference between the offensive performance during the first 2 minutes of each quarter.

But why does this happen? Is it affected by the pace of the game? Let's check the possessions per minute

We also found out that teams perform better offensively in the first half mainly because there are more possessions in the first half than in the second half.

## [Project 4: NBA: First minutes of a game (Part 2)](https://github.com/MarlinMyrte/First-Minutes-Part-2)

We discovered that there are teams which have a larger difference in their offensive performance in the first 2 minutes of each quarter compared to their offensive performance in the first 10 minutes of each quarter.

**So what if this "2-minute slump" didn't exist? How would the standings be different?**

Please note that the standings are as of February 28th 2022.

In the Eastern Conference, we can see that the 76ers jumped from the 3rd place to the 2nd place which is something that could change a lot during the Playoffs and also the Wizards went up to the 10th place

Ιn the Western Conference, the Lakers moved up a spot and are in the playoff picture and the Clippers are in the play-in tournament
